# Warden’s Mirrors — Tech Extract (Godot)

Public, sanitized extract from an indie game project focused on data-driven narrative UI and a sanity system.
This repository contains **selected code snippets + documentation** (not a full playable build).

## What this shows
- Modular UI flow (DialogueView + ChoicePanel + RoomController)
- Data-driven content (SQLite → JSON cache)
- Sanity system that affects UI/text presentation (rules-based)

## What is intentionally NOT included
- Full Godot project and assets (graphics/audio)
- Production data files / internal IDs
- A runnable demo build

## Repository map
- `docs/` — architecture and systems overview
- `snippets/` — selected GDScript files (core logic)
- `samples/` — synthetic data examples (JSON)
- `screenshots/` — current UI snapshot
